    <title>Introducing Hrorm a Simple, Declarative, Type-Checked ORM</title>
</head>
<body>

<h4>A Question</h4>

<p>A lot of cyber ink has been spilled about the problem of connecting the models in Java code
    with models in relational (SQL) databases. The topic of object relational mappings (ORMs), is
    indeed rich and the full scope of things you might want to do to transfer information between
    an application and a database is enormous. Many ORM tools attempt to cover as much of that
    space as they possibly can: their designs and implementations provide for a great deal of
    flexibility and they are packed with features.</p>

<p>Of course, to achieve that flexibility they are burdened with complexity. This
    is not their fault: Java and SQL are quite different worlds and covering all (or even many) of the ways to
    pull them together is intrinsically complex. What about a different approach? What if instead
    of designing an ORM tool to handle a wide variety of object and schema models and all
    the accompanying use-cases, an ORM tool was designed with some assumptions in mind
    about how objects and schemas look and work and how they are used? How simple could an
    ORM tool be?</p>


<h4>The JDBC</h4>

<p>The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API defines how almost all interactions between
    relational databases and Java applications happen. Database makers provide an implementation
    of the interfaces defined in the java.sql package and clients can do a great many
    database tasks through those interfaces, almost everything except actually starting the database.</p>

<p>In greatly over-simplified terms, the JDBC defines three interfaces:
    <code>java.sql.Connection</code>,
    <code>java.sql.Statement</code>, and <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code>. A
    <code>Connection</code> represents a pipe or socket between the application
    and the database engine. Messages in the form of <code>Strings</code> can be passed
    through the pipe using a <code>Statement</code> and responses
    read from the <code>ResultSet</code>.</p>

<p>The JDBC is a low-level interface, but it actually specifies very little of
    how applications and databases interact, since it takes no position on what form
    the SQL being sent to the database takes. You can use the JDBC to send arbitrary
    strings of SQL to the database. It is entirely up to the database to parse and
    execute it, assuming it even is SQL. So, databases that provide quite different dialects
    of SQL with wildly varying extensions are all supported by the JDBC, so long
    as they conform to the basic pattern of accepting queries as SQL strings
    and responding with tabular data.</p>

<p>Depending on how you look at it this makes the JDBC tremendously powerful
    (you can do almost anything) or terribly anemic (the abstractions are not suitable
    for high-level programming). In theory though, simply by using the JDBC interfaces
    almost any interaction a Java application needs to have with a relational database
    can be managed. It just might take a lot of repetitive code to get there.</p>

<p>The repetitive nature of the code cannot be over-stated. First, you have
    to write all the SQL yourself, generally as literal strings. The JDBC provides
    nothing to help with this. Additionally, the somewhat varied syntax of SQL means
    the selects, inserts, updates, and deletes all
    have to be written to some extent separately. Then each must be passed down
    a <code>Connection</code> within a <code>Statement</code> and the <code>ResultSet</code>
    (if relevant)
    handled slightly differently. Then the results must be parsed into
    the application's object model. Throughout this, care must be taken to correctly
    release resources lest the database run out of connections or cursors or what
    have you. And of course, even the <code>close()</code> methods all throw
    the checked <code>SQLException</code>, so everything has to be wrapped in
    (possibly nested) try-catch-finally blocks. All this before things like
    joins and the whole universe of other possible optimizations have been considered.</p>

<p>It's tedious code to write and inevitably cut-and-paste errors or worse end up
    in anyone's work.</p>

<h4>ORMs</h4>

<p>Therefore, one of the primary reasons to use an ORM is simply to avoid writing and maintaining all the
    boilerplate code that directly using the JDBC requires. If you had an army of
    low-paid, unambitious interns, you might never bother.</p>

<p>The JDBC is a direct modeling of database concepts as Java classes
    and interfaces. The code that results is therefore somewhat stilted, in
    addition to being quite verbose. One approach to improving matters is
    to provide a more modern, idiomatic set of classes for clients to use.
    Libraries like <a href="http://jdbi.org/">JDBI</a> take this approach.
    Everything is still in the application
    developer's hands, in fact, the JDBI webpage claims it is not an ORM since
    it does not provide for caching or state tracking and the like. It still requires
    developers to write SQL themselves. It greatly diminishes the amount of code
    applications contain compared with raw JDBC though. Sometimes, JDBI is
    referred to as "a better JDBC".</p>

<p>Other ORMs (assuming we can call JDBI an ORM, meaning no offense to the
    authors), have more ambition in terms of managing the how an application manages
    interactions with the database. The granddaddy of Java ORM tools is
    <a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>, which
    actually helped to define how the javax.persistence package was built.</p>

<p>Hibernate is now an extensive ecosystem of tools that reach far beyond
    the original goal of reducing the boilerplate code needed to write applications
    directly using the JDBC. There are tutorials and documentation and conferences
    and books about Hibernate. And for some, that itself is the problem. What started out
    as a straight-forward problem of a mass of repetitive code being shaved down
    to size is now a whole domain problem in itself, requiring the
    investment of time and study. Learning all about Hibernate presumably has rewards of
    its own, but it does come with (at least) two problems. First, Hibernate's power and
    flexibility mean that even the simple things are actually complicated under
    the hood. Unexpected behaviors like caching can be introduced when you do not
    want them. Second, when it comes time to do some optimization (pass a query
    hint to the DB, create a join in a particular way, etc) it can be hard to know
    how to get Hibernate to cooperate with that effort. Gone are the days when
    you could just pass strings of SQL directly to the database.</p>

<h4>Introducing Hrorm</h4>

<p>For many projects, a domain model of Java-bean like classes can be backed with a store
    of tables one-to-one. <a href="http://hrorm.org">Hrorm</a>
    is a library that exists to make it easy to create data access objects (DAOs) that
    can perform the basic CRUD operations for Java-bean like classes. It has some restrictions
    on how your object model and schema are designed and it won't do everything you can possibly
    want when communicating from your application to your database, but you won't have to
    invest in a library of O'Reilly books to use it.</p>

<p>Hrorm allows the easy creation of <code>Dao&lt;T&gt;</code> objects, which allow
    you to insert, select, update, and delete instances of type <code>T</code>. To create
    a Dao object, you use the DaoBuilder class, which provides a declarative, fluent, type-safe
    interface for describing the relationship between a database schema and a Java
    object model. An application with an ingredient domain model like this:</p>

<pre>
    class Ingredient {
        // getters and setters omitted, use your imagination
        long id;
        long recipeId;
        String name;
        int amount;
    }
</pre>

<p>That was backed by a database table that looks like this:</p>

<pre>
    TABLE INGREDIENT (
        ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        RECIPE_ID INTEGER,
        NAME VARCHAR,
        AMOUNT INTEGER
    );
</pre>

<p>Could have its persistence managed by a hrorm <code>Dao</code> that was created like this:</p>

<pre>
    DaoBuilder&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientDaoBuilder = new DaoBuilder&lt;&gt;("INGREDIENT", Ingredient::new)
        .withPrimaryKey("ID", "INGREDIENT_SEQUENCE", Ingredient::getId, Ingredient::setId)
        .withParentColumn("RECIPE_ID")
        .withStringColumn("NAME", Ingredient::getName, Ingredient::setName)
        .withIntegerColumn("AMOUNT", Ingredient::getAmount, Ingredient::setAmount);
</pre>

<p>Using a DaoBuilder and a <code>java.sql.Connection</code> object, you can create a <code>Dao</code>,
    like this.</p>

<pre>
    Dao&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientDao = ingredientDaoBuilder.build(connection);
</pre>

<p>And we're done. No writing SQL. No exception handling or resource management. No
    iterating through results. Just a simple <code>Dao&lt;T&gt;</code> object that
    has methods for doing the standard CRUD operations
    <code>insert()</code>, <code>update()</code>, and <code>delete()</code> that
    act on objects of type <code>T</code>. In addition, there are a variety of <code>select()</code>
    methods for reading data from the database that return individual <code>T</code>
    instances or <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on how domain models must be designed to work with hrorm that are
    reflected here. For instance, entities must have an integer (in Java terms, long) valued primary key,
    and the primary key must be generated from a database sequence that hrorm can access.</p>

<p>To say that's all there is to hrorm would be untrue. There is some more to learn,
    primarily about how to handle one-to-one and many-to-one relations within your
    code and schema. You can read about that in the <a href="http://hrorm.org/documentation/latest/">hrorm
        documentation</a>. But really, you've already learned
    most of what you need to know to start using hrorm. It's a library, not a framework: it
    does not require any configuration, have any external dependencies, start any background
    threads, or pollute your domain model with annotations.</p>

<p>And since hrorm only needs a standard JDBC <code>Connection</code> object, it's easy
    to outgrow. You can replace hrorm generated <code>Dao</code> objects with your custom,
    optimized code piece by piece, and only as necessary. Since hrorm takes a quasi-functional
    approach to its implementation (no hidden caching or state tracking) there is no perplexing
    behavior to debug. Calling a hrorm method results in SQL being sent to the database on
    the calling thread.</p>

<p>Hrorm does not even try to manage the full scope of things that you might want to do
    with your database or application. But it quickly gets your objects persisted with the
    minimum fuss. For many of us, modern ORM tools provide functionality we do not need at
    a price that we should not be required to pay.</p>
