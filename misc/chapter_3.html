    In the Java world, the hardest part of selecting tools can be the
    over-abundance of choices. There's something ridiculous about writing
    a new object relational mapping library. There are already a large
    number of choices, including, the Java Persistence API,
    now part of the standard library.

<p>
    When I started a new project last year, I could not find what I wanted.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>SQL generation</li>
    <li>Simple object-based API for CRUD operations</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<p>
    And a list of things I did not want.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>External configuration or containers</li>
    <li>Caching or lazy-loading</li>
</ul>

<p>
    TOPICS:
    * Dao builder: interface clarity versus sharing code, problems with inheritance
    * Dependencies and logging
    * Frameworks versus libraries
    * meta-programming, annotations and reflection (unsafe)
    * lack of type-checking for where clauses
    * Lack of optimization (Hrorm is really slow)
    * packages/namespacing
    * Jobs to do:
        * Generate SQL - should be efficient (i.e. joins)
        * Build objects from result sets
        * Manage resources properly, closing things
