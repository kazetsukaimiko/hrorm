<p>
    Hrorm provides a mechanism for building {@link Dao} objects.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm facilitates the creation of <code>Dao</code> objects: which support
    basic CRUD operations on a relational (SQL) database: <code>insert</code>,
    <code>select</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>delete</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <code>Dao</code> objects are created by using a {@link DaoBuilder} object. The <code>DaoBuilder</code>
    provides a declarative, fluent interface for describing the relationship between
    the Java object to be persisted and the underlying schema that supports it.
</p>

<p>
    While almost all the classes and methods in this package are public, there is little need to
    use them directly. Other than the <code>DaoBuilder</code>, <code>Dao</code>, and <code>HrormException</code>
    clients should not have to reference anything in this package.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm intentionally converts all checked <code>SQLException</code> instances that arise to
    <code>HrormException</code> objects, which extend <code>RuntimeException</code>. Do not be
    fooled, Hrorm is not magical and exceptions can happen.
