<p>
    Hrorm is a concise, declarative, type-checked library for the creation of Data Access Objects (DAOs).
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm provides a simple, declarative mechanism to describe
    the relationship between an object model in Java code and a relational
    model described in a SQL schema of tables and sequences.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm is an opinionated tool. To use it requires that your database schema
    and Java object model are set up in a particular way. Additionally, hrorm lacks many
    features (like caching and lazy-loading) that some ORM tools provide. Hrorm's
    philosophy is to make the easy stuff easy, and get out of the way in
    other cases.

<p>
    Hrorm is a free software project.
