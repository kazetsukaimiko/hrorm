<p>
    Hrorm provides a mechanism for building Dao objects.
</p>

<p>
    The intention is to provide a simple, declarative mechanism to describe
    the relationship between an object model in Java code and a relational
    model described in a SQL schema of tables and sequences.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm is an opinionated tool. To use it requires that your database schema
    and Java object model are set up in a particular way. Hrorm is in no way
    a substitute for a fully featured ORM tool.
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm is an open source project.
