    <a href="http://hrorm.org" target="_top">Hrorm</a> is a concise, declarative, type-checked library for the creation of Data Access Objects (DAOs).
</p>

<p>
    Hrorm is an opinionated tool. To use it requires that your database schema
    and Java object model are set up in a particular way. Additionally, hrorm lacks many
    features (like caching and lazy-loading) that some ORM tools provide. Hrorm's
    philosophy is to make the easy stuff easy, and get out of the way in
    other cases.
</p>

<p>
    To use hrorm the relationship between an entity's Java representation and database
    representation is defined using a {@link org.hrorm.DaoBuilder}
    (or {@link org.hrorm.IndirectDaoBuilder} for immutable models)
    in order to create a {@link org.hrorm.Dao}
    that can handle basic persistence and querying tasks.
