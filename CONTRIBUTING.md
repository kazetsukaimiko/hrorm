### Thanks for considering making a contribution to Hrorm.

1. Go for it. Hrorm is a small, backwater project and an easy place to get your feet wet.
1. Learn the Hrorm ethos. 
   View the [hrorm.org](https://hrorm.org) website to learn more about that. 
   Hrorm definitely has a point-of-view.
   Additions that would do any of the following things will almost certainly be rejected.
   * Add a dependency to Hrorm.
   * Add laziness or threading constructs to Hrorm.
   * Add external configuration to Hrorm.
   
   And the list continues. If you want a more complicated ORM tool, there are many to choose from.
1. Write tests. 
   Hrorm is pretty well tested and very easy to write tests for.
   Tests are essential not just to ensure correctness, but as documentation of what your feature is for and how it is to be used.
   Even if you do not know how to implement what you want, a test is the best way of communicating it.
   A test shows how an API is to be used, and a failing test shows what work is left to be done.
